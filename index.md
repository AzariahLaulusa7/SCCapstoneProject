## Why BreatheEasy?
In today's over-demanding and fast-paced world, it is easy to feel overwhelmed and depressed at times. What if you had a way to escape? Welcome to BreatheEasy.\
BreatheEasy's main goal is to help users with their mental health by providing several options for dealing with negative feelings, like anxiety and stress. From engaging mini-games to calming breathing exercises, each feature is designed to empower you towards better mental health. It's the 24/7 immediate support you need the most.

Anticipated users include everyday people like you and me. Stress can arise in many different forms. Students face academic related stress, especially during exam season. Businessmen and businesswomen face pressure to perform, develop products, and work long hours, all of which are stress inducing. Parents of young children face sleep deprevation, exhaustion, and endless hard work in the process of raising their families. The elderly often face stress related to aging, declining health, and isolation as family members move away from home. BreatheEasy looks to provide connection, stress relief, opportunity for reflection, and the opportunity to take a quick break and BreatheEasy.

Our app impliments breathing exercises, journaling, physical activity, stress-relieving games, the opportunity to connect with other users, and the ability to contact mental health professionals.

Breathing exercises are proven to relieve stress mentally and physically. Controlled breathing can lower the heart rate and blood pressure of an individual as well as increasing blood flow. All of these positivly impact mental health.

Physical activity is another well-known stress reliever. Physical activity increases physical health, blood flow, and can contribute to a positive body image. Physical activity also can incorporate going outdoors and is a great escape from stress factors. We included physical activity options in BreatheEasy because they are scalable. From a seasoned athlete to a couch potato, exercise can range from simple situps, pushups, and other bodyweight exercises to running, weightlifting, and other complicated exercises, perfect for users of any ability.

Journaling is the opportunity for reflection. Mental health can be improved by recording thoughts and emotions to help the user reflect on their mental state. Journaling is a powerful way to process stress, trauma, and other emotions. Journaling can help anxiety by allowing users to record, compartmentalize, and move on from damaging thoughts. 

Games are a way to provide distraction, stress relief and a small sense of accomplishment. BreatheEasy impliments several minigames to let the user escape stressful situations. Successfully completing a small task such as a minigame can give the user a sense of pride and accomplishment, which can be used as the first step in a series of larger accomplishments. 

Because those who struggle with mental health often feel alienated or misunderstood, BreatheEasy provides a sense of community through forum posts. Users can encourage each other, vent their struggles, and ask for advice in a virtual setting. Stress can often go hand-in-hand with lonliness, and BreatheEasy provides users with an opportunity to make connections with others to ease that feeling.

When mental health conditions become severe, it is appropriate to consult professionals. BreatheEasy makes it easy to contact professional counselors and emergency services with the Crisis Line feature. Prominently displayed is the ability to call for help via 911 (Emergency services), 988 (Suicide and Crisis Lifeline), and the Crisis Text Line with this feature. BreatheEasy also provides contact information for local mental health professionals and instant access to a chatbot therapist for non-emergency service. The Crisis Line feature makes sure every user has access to the help they need.
